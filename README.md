# Network Security Projects

This repository houses a series of cybersecurity projects focused on simulating and analyzing common network attacks, their mitigation strategies, and associated tools. The projects cover a variety of network security topics, including SYN Flood, Smurf, Fraggle, Session Hijacking, and IP Spoofing. Each project is designed to provide hands-on experience with network security concepts and real-world attack scenarios.

## Projects Overview

### **1. SYN Flood Attack and Prevention**
This project involves simulating a **SYN Flood Attack** against a web server, utilizing **hping3** to generate a large volume of SYN packets and analyzing the attack with **Wireshark**. The attack is mitigated using **iptables** for rate limiting and **Snort** for detection and alerting.

**Key Tools Used:**
- **hping3**: To simulate SYN Flood attacks.
- **Wireshark**: For packet capture and traffic analysis.
- **iptables**: To filter and limit incoming SYN packets.
- **Snort**: For real-time attack detection and alerting.

**Process Overview:**
- Deploy and configure a web server (Apache or Nginx).
- Use **Wireshark** to monitor network traffic and observe the TCP handshake.
- Launch the SYN Flood attack with **hping3**.
- Implement mitigations using **iptables** and detect attack patterns with **Snort**.

### **2. Session Hijacking at ShopFast E-commerce Platform**
In this project , a **session hijacking** attack is simulated on ShopFast, an e-commerce platform. The attacker intercepts session cookies via **man-in-the-middle (MITM)** attacks and impersonates legitimate users.

**Key Tools Used:**
- **Wireshark**: For monitoring and capturing session cookies.
- **MITM tools**: To perform session hijacking attacks.

**Incident Overview:**
- Attackers hijack sessions by intercepting session cookies from public Wi-Fi networks.
- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)** and enhanced **session management** are implemented post-attack.

### **3. Smurf Attack on UniNet Educational Network**
A **Smurf Attack** is simulated to disrupt the network by sending ICMP echo request packets (ping) to a broadcast address with a spoofed source address. The attack results in network congestion, which is mitigated by filtering incoming ICMP traffic.

**Key Tools Used:**
- **hping3**: For sending ICMP packets in a Smurf attack.
- **ICMP Flood**: To simulate the attack.

**Process Overview:**
- Simulate the attack by flooding the target network with spoofed ICMP requests.
- Implement **ICMP traffic filtering** to prevent broadcast amplification.

### **4. Fraggle Attack on CitySmart Digital Infrastructure**
The **Fraggle Attack** is a variant of the Smurf attack using **UDP echo packets** instead of ICMP. This project focuses on how UDP-based attacks can overwhelm a target system’s network capacity.

**Key Tools Used:**
- **hping3**: To send UDP echo requests.
- **UDP Flood**: For simulating the attack.

**Process Overview:**
- Simulate the **Fraggle Attack** on CitySmart’s digital infrastructure.
- Mitigate the attack by blocking incoming **UDP echo requests** and implementing fail-safes.

### **5. IP Spoofing Attack on GreenValley University**
This project demonstrates how **IP spoofing** is used to mask the attacker’s IP address and gain unauthorized access to GreenValley University’s systems. **Scapy** is employed for crafting and sending malicious packets.

**Key Tools Used:**
- **Scapy**: For crafting and sending spoofed IP packets.
- **iptables**: For filtering spoofed packets and preventing unauthorized access.

**Process Overview:**
- Simulate an IP spoofing attack to bypass security measures.
- Implement mitigation using **firewall rules** and **IP filtering**.

## Post-Incident Measures and Mitigation Strategies

For each of the above attacks, **post-incident measures** have been implemented to harden the systems and prevent future occurrences. These include:
- **Network Hardening**: Implementing stronger defense mechanisms against future attacks.
- **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)**: Deploying real-time monitoring and response systems.
- **Staff Training and Awareness**: Educating personnel on attack patterns and defensive strategies.

## How to Run These Projects

Each project is designed to be executed on a **Linux-based system**, ideally **Kali Linux** for the offensive tools, and **Ubuntu** or similar distributions for the victim systems. Detailed setup and execution instructions for each project are available in their respective folders.

### Prerequisites:
- A **Linux-based environment** (Kali Linux or Ubuntu).
- Basic knowledge of **network security tools** (Wireshark, hping3, iptables, Snort).
- Access to a **target server** or virtual machine for testing.

## Conclusion

These projects offer a practical approach to understanding and mitigating various network security threats. By simulating real-world attacks, the goal is to gain hands-on experience in defending against common vulnerabilities and strengthening network security measures.
